In the directory semaphores, there are following files:

* mutual_exclusion.c: Demonstrates the use of a semaphore for achieving mutual exclusion.
* prod_cons.c : Demonstrates the use of semaphores for producer consumer problem.

In the directory sequencers and event counts there are following files:

* prodcons_eventcounts.c: Demonstrates the use of sequencers and eventcounts for producer consumer problem in thread synchronization.

Outside:

* File: q4_exam.c: An alternative solution to weak reader preference solution.

* File: q3c_exam.c: A sychronization solution using semaphores only for simultanous access to files
